# Ensures that the program doesn't print "Finished..." until both threads are done.

# ðŸš§ Important Detail: GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)
# Python has a GIL (in CPython, the default implementation), which means:
# Only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time.
# But for I/O-bound tasks (like sleep, file reading, API calls), the GIL is released, allowing other threads to run.
# So in this case:
# While one thread is sleeping (waiting), the GIL is released.
# The other thread can run in parallel â€” that's why this program benefits from threading.
